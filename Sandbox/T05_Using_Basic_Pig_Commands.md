##Tutorial 5: Using Basic Pig Commands

**This tutorial is from the [Hortonworks Sandbox 2.0](http://hortonworks.com/products/sandbox) - a single-node Hadoop cluster running in a virtual machine. [Download](http://hortonworks.com/products/sandbox) the Hortonworks Sandbox to run this and other tutorials in the series.**

### Tutorial Overview
This tutorial will enable you to gain a working knowledge of Pig and
hands-on experience creating Pig scripts to carry out essential data
operations and tasks.

In this tutorial, you will first read in two data files that contain New
York Stock Exchange dividend prices and stock prices, and then use these
files to perform a number of Pig operations including:

-   Define a relation with and without schema
-   Define a new relation from an existing relation
-   Select specific columns from within a relation
-   Join two relations
-   Sort the data using 'ORDER BY'
-   FILTER and Group the data using 'GROUP BY'

This tutorial was derived from one of the lab problems in the
Hortonworks Developer training class. The developer training class
covers uses of the tools in the Hortonworks Data Platform and how to
develop applications and projects using the Hortonworks Data Platform.

### What is Pig?

Pig is a high level scripting language that is used with Apache Hadoop.
Pig enables data workers to write complex data transformations without
knowing Java. Pig's simple SQL-like scripting language is called Pig
Latin, and appeals to developers already familiar with scripting
languages and SQL.

Pig is complete, so you can do all required data manipulations in Apache
Hadoop with Pig. Through the User Defined Functions(UDF) facility in
Pig, Pig can invoke code in many languages like JRuby, Jython and Java.
You can also embed Pig scripts in other languages. The result is that
you can use Pig as a component to build larger and more complex
applications that tackle real business problems.

Pig works with data from many sources, including structured and
unstructured data, and store the results into the Hadoop Data File
System.

Pig scripts are translated into a series of MapReduce jobs that are run
on the Apache Hadoop cluster.

### Download the Data

You'll need sample data for this tutorial. The data set you will be
using is stock ticker data from the New York Stock Exchange from the
years 2000-2001. Download this sample data from the following location:

[https://s3.amazonaws.com/hw-sandbox/tutorial1/infochimps\_dataset\_4778\_download\_16677-csv.zip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hw-sandbox/tutorial1/infochimps_dataset_4778_download_16677-csv.zip)

The file is about 11 megabytes, and might take a few minutes to
download.

Open the folder  **infochimps_dataset_4778_download_16677 > NYSE**
and locate the two data files that you will be using for this tutorial:

-   `NYSE_daily_prices_A.csv`
-   `NYSE_dividends_A.csv`

### Step 1: Upload the data files

Select the File Browser from the top tool bar. The File Browser allows
you to view the Hortonworks Data Platform(HDP) file store. The HDP file
system is separate from the local file system.

![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-1.jpg?raw=true)

Click **Upload** and select **Files**to load data to HDFS:

![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-2.jpg?raw=true)

This action brings up the following dialog box:

![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-3.jpg?raw=true)

Click **Select files**, navigate to and select the
`NYSE_daily_prices_A.csv` file from your computer. Upload the
`NYSE_dividends_A.csv` file in the same way. When finished, notice that
both files are now in HDFS.

![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-5.jpg?raw=true)

### Step 2: Create Your Script

Open the Pig interface by clicking the Pig icon at the top of the
screen. On the left pane is a list of your scripts and on the right pane
is a composition area for writing and editing scripts.

A special feature of the interface is the PIG helper at the bottom,
which provides templates for Pig statements, functions, I/O statements,
HCatLoader() and Python user defined functions.

Notice status areas at the bottom of the screen. When you run scripts
you can view the results of your script and log files.

![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-6.jpg?raw=true)

Enter "Pig-Dividend" for the title of your script:

![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-7.jpg?raw=true)

### Step 3: Define a relation

In this step, you will create a script to load the data and define a
relation.

-   On line 1 define a relation named STOCK_A that represents the NYSE
    stocks that start with the letter “A”
-   On line 2 use the DESCRIBE command to view the STOCK_A relation

The completed code will look like:

`STOCK_A = LOAD 'nyse/NYSE_daily_prices_A.csv' using PigStorage(','); DESCRIBE STOCK_A; `
![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-8.jpg?raw=true)

### Step 4: Save and Execute the Script

Click the **Save** button to save your changes to the script. Click
**Execute** to run the script. This action creates one or more MapReduce
jobs. After a moment, the script starts and the Execute button changes
to a **Kill job** button in case you want to stop the job.

Below the Execute/Kill job button is a progress bar that shows the job's
status. The progress bar can be blue (indicating job is in process), red
(job has a problem), or green (job is complete).

![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-9.jpg?raw=true)

When the job completes, check the results in the green box. You can also
download results to your system by clicking the download icon. Notice
STOCK_A does not have a schema because we did not define one when
loading the data into relation STOCK_A.

![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-10.jpg?raw=true)

### Step 5: Define a Relation with a Schema

Let's use the above code but this time with a schema. Modify line 1 of
your script and add the following "AS"" clause to define a schema for
the daily stock price data. The complete code will be:

`STOCK_A = LOAD 'NYSE_daily_prices_A.csv' using PigStorage(',') AS (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray, date:chararray, open:float, high:float, low:float, close:float, volume:int, adj_close:float); DESCRIBE STOCK_A;`
![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-11.jpg?raw=true)

Save and execute the script again. This time you should see the schema
for the STOCK_A relation:

![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-12.jpg?raw=true)

### Step 6: Define a new relation from an existing relation

You can define a new relation based on an existing one. For example,
define the following B relation, which is a collection of 100 entries
(arbitrarily selected) from the STOCK_A relation.

Add the following line to the end of your code:

`B = LIMIT STOCK_A 100; DESCRIBE B; `
![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-13.jpg?raw=true)

Save and execute the code. Notice B has the same schema as STOCK_A,
because B is a subset of A relation.

![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-14.jpg?raw=true)

### Step 7: View the Data

To view the data of a relation, use the DUMP command.

Add the following DUMP command to your Pig script, then save and execute
it again:

`Dump B;` ![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-15.jpg?raw=true)

The command requires a MapReduce job to execute, so you will need to
wait a minute or two for the job to complete. The output should be 100
entries from the contents of NYSE_daily_prices_A.csv (and not
necessarily the ones shown below, because again, entries are arbitrarily
chosen):

![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-16.jpg?raw=true)

### Step 8: Select specific columns from a relation

Delete the DESCRIBE STOCK_A, DESCRIBE B, and DUMP B commands from your
Pig script; you will no longer need those.

One of the key uses of Pig is data transformation. You can define a new
relation based on the fields of an existing relation using the FOREACH
command. Define a new relation C, which will contain only the symbol,
date and close fields from relation B.

Now the complete code is:

`STOCK_A = LOAD 'NYSE_daily_prices_A.csv' using PigStorage(',') AS (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray, date:chararray, open:float, high:float, low:float, close:float, volume:int, adj_close:float); B = LIMIT STOCK_A 100; C = FOREACH B GENERATE symbol, date, close; DESCRIBE C; `
![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-17.jpg?raw=true)

Save and execute the script and your output will look like the
following:

![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-18.jpg?raw=true)

### Step 9: Store relationship data into a HDFS File

In this step, you will use the STORE command to output a relation into a
new file in HDFS. Enter the following command to output the C relation
to a folder named output/C (then save and execute):

`STORE C INTO 'output/C';` ![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-19.jpg?raw=true)

Again, this requires a MapReduce job (just like the DUMP command), so
you will need to wait a minute for the job to complete.

Once the job is finished, go to File Browser and look for a newly
created folder called "output":

![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-20.jpg?raw=true)

Click on "output" folder. You will find a subfolder named "C".

![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-21.jpg?raw=true)

Click on "C" folder. You will see an output file called "part-r-00000":

![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-22.jpg?raw=true)

Click on the file "part-r-00000". It will show data stored in the file:

![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-23.jpg?raw=true)

### Step 10: Perform a join between 2 relations

In this step, you will perform a join on two NYSE data sets: the daily
prices and the dividend prices. Dividends prices are shown for the
quarter, while stock prices are represented on a daily basis.

You have already defined a relation for the stocks named STOCK_A.
Create a new Pig script named "Pig-Join". Then define a new relation
named DIV_A that represents the dividends for stocks that start with an
"A", then join A and B by both the symbol and date and describe the
schema of the new relation C.

The complete code will be:

`STOCK_A = LOAD 'NYSE_daily_prices_A.csv'          using PigStorage(',')      AS (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray,      date:chararray, open:float, high:float, low:float,      close:float, volume:int, adj_close:float); DIV_A = LOAD 'NYSE_dividends_A.csv'          using PigStorage(',')      AS (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray, date:chararray,      dividend:float); C = JOIN STOCK_A BY (symbol, date), DIV_A BY (symbol, date); DESCRIBE C;`
![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-24.jpg?raw=true)

Save the script and execute it. Notice C contains all the fields of both
STOCK_A and DIV_A. You can use the DUMP command to see the data stored
in the relation C:

![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-25.jpg?raw=true)

### Step 11: Sort the data using "ORDER BY"

Use the ORDER BY command to sort a relation by one or more of its
fields. Create a new Pig script named "Pig-sort" and enter the following
commands to sort the dividends by symbol then date in ascending order:

`DIV_A = LOAD 'NYSE_dividends_A.csv'      using PigStorage(',')      AS (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray, date:chararray,      dividend:float); B = ORDER DIV_A BY symbol, date asc; DUMP B;`
![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-26.jpg?raw=true)

Save and execute the script. Your output should be sorted as shown here:

![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-27.jpg?raw=true)

### Step 12: Filter and Group the data using "GROUP BY"

The GROUP command allows you to group a relation by one of its fields.
Create a new Pig script named "Pig-group". Then, enter the following
commands, which group the DIV_A relation by the dividend price for the
"AZZ" stock.

`DIV_A = LOAD 'NYSE_dividends_A.csv'      using PigStorage(',')      AS (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray, date:chararray,      dividend:float); B = FILTER DIV_A BY symbol=='AZZ'; C = GROUP B BY dividend; DESCRIBE C; DUMP C;`
![](./images/tutorial-5/Pig-28.jpg?raw=true)

Save and execute. Notice that the data for stock symbol "AZZ" is grouped
together for each dividend.
